# Data
The following data files might be of interest:

* [US Samle](data/intermediate/cleaned_US.csv) Cleaned data with constructed scales for analysis of the US MTurk sample in which we test whether people have more algorithmic appreciation when consuming news to pass time, entertain oneself or escape from daily worries than when using news to keep up-to-date with politics (_hypotheses 1_) and. whether people are confident in their own cognitive abilities moderates that relationship (_hypothesis 2_).
* [Dutch Sample](data/intermediate/cleaned_NL.csv) Cleaned data with constructed scales for analysis of the Dutch PollFish sample in which we test whether people have more algorithmic appreciation when consuming news to pass time, entertain oneself or escape from daily worries than when using news to keep up-to-date with politics (_hypotheses 1_) and. whether people are confident in their own cognitive abilities moderates that relationship (_hypothesis 2_).
